2. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and sorts it in ascending order.
3. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and sorts it in descending order.
4. Create a function that generates an array of 10 first names from your class, where the names are entered by the user, and sorts it alphabetically.
5. Create a function that generates a random array of 10 ages and sorts it in descending order.

7. Create a new program that includes:
   - An array of 10 tech companies, and for each company, display its name on the screen.
   - An array of 12 images, display the images on the page in a 3x4 grid.
   - An array of 10 objects, each containing a company name, city, and image, display the array on the screen in a 3x4 grid.
   - Add fields for id, domain, and a link to the company's page.

9. Create a function that takes an array of objects, each containing age, first name, and last name. If the age is above 18, it should print the first name to the screen; otherwise, it should print the last name.
10. Create 5 different elements with the same class and print them to the console separately.
11. Create 5 text elements with different text content. Create a button that changes their color to blue and another button that changes the text of all elements to "hello."
12. Create an object with 4 fields and print each field on a separate line. Print each value on a separate line.
13. Create a function that generates an object and takes first name, last name, and age from the user and prints the fields and values neatly on the screen.
14. Challenge: Create an array of 4 objects, each with fields for first name, last name, date of birth, and email.
15. Display the data in a table, with each object in its own row.
